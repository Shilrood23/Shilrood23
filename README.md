I have recently graduated from a rigorous 6-month cybersecurity boot camp passing my Comptia security plus certification. I have a profound interest in technology, protecting clients' assets, and a dedication to solving complex problems.

My journey in computer science has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
